# Uptime
- We now have at least one sysadmin on-call 24/7 for major issues sent to emergency@gnome.org or picked up by Nagios  (Currently Andrea and Patrick switch daily)

# ...and a new member!
Wondering who Patrick is? Patrick 'puiterwijk' Uiterwijk is a new addition to the Sysadmin Team helping me sharing the load! It's
amazing how much passionate he is about his new role on the team!

- static.gnome.org, it is currently serving all the static content for the various GNOME websites! 
- GlusterFS is now being used on our data servers!
  - it substituted our old NFS node

# Backups:     
- New backups solution!       
- One of the Fedora's main backup machines makes use of rdiff-backup to backup every single GNOME machine
- rdiff-backup allows us to benefit from both incremental and historical backups
- Only downside is the Fedora machine being hosted on the same DC as the GNOME machines (not ideal as a Disaster Recovery plan) 
- Soon an off-site backup facility. 
- Thanks to Kevin, Patrick and Stephen for helping us out on this!
