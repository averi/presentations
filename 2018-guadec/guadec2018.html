# Services: cgit to GitLab

- We moved our VCS and bugs reporting platform to GitLab
- Cgit has been retired already, Bugzilla is still temporarily online: will be made RO
- A build infrastructure has been built and tied to GitLab:
  - builders picking up jobs as they reach their queue limit 
  - on demand AWS and DigitalOcean builders (thanks to GitLab for refunding as much credits
    as we consume on these external services!)

# Future plans 

- The general idea is moving away from the service(s) == VM equation
- Openshift as the next generation platform:
  - Self-hosted cluster
  - GNOME services as containers
  - Direct integration with GitLab
  - GNOME developers responsible for specific apps having free access to
    modify, build and deploy services they own
