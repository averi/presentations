### Core Technologies in use

- Openshift 4
- Openshift Virtualization
- Ceph Storage (2 clusters)
- GitLab CI/CD
- Quay.io
- Prometheus/Alertmanager

### Hardware specs

- 3 Dell R650 - 260G RAM, 56 cores, OCP 4
- 3 Dell R640 - 190G RAM, 48 cores, Ceph

### Architecture

- For OCP 4
  - 3 nodes cluster, masters == workers
  - LB via DNS RR (not ideal, we approached several
    vendors in order to receive a discount for any of
    the available LB services, no luck as of today)
  - On demand SSD storage via Rook
  - Support for container and VM based workloads (OCP Virt)
  - Infrastructure as code: each of the hosted tenants
    is managed on GitLab with images built via CI/CD and
    pushed to quay.io for consumption
  - Monitored via Prometheus, Alertmanager
  - Cert management handled via cert-manager and LE

- For Ceph, 3 nodes cluster, storage types:
  - Block
  - CephFS
  - RadosGW

- For GitLab:
  - Most of the services running on a single VM
  - Pages runs on OCP 4
  - Storage for static content lives on S3
  - Repositories on Ceph RBD

???
About quay.io benefits: no need to maintain a self hosted
image registry + unlimited number of publicly available
images.

### Architecture

For Prometheus:
 - Multiple exporters: OCP 4, BBB, Node, GitLab, Ceph
 - Grafana with multiple datasources
 - Alertmanager with a set of predefined rules + Pagerduty
 - Blackbox for anything HTTP/HTTPS and latency monitoring

### Achievements over the past 4 years

- Ceph cluster architecture and deployment
- OCP 3 deployment and mass migration of services
  from VMs to containers
- OCP 4 deployment and migration from OCP 3 (EOL in June 2022)
- RHEL 7 to RHEL 8
- Puppet --> Ansible
- Nagios --> Prometheus/Alertmanager
- Static resources served via CDN77

### CI/CD @ GNOME - Achievements

- Switched to Fedora, latest kernel
- Docuum deployed to keep disk usage in check
  - Image removal kicks in after certain disk usage is passed
  - It tracks used images, least used are removed first
- All runners shared so non just GNOME projects can use them
  â€“ This to improve developer experience and make CI feedback
    cycle faster for contributors
- We combine dockerd with crun from github.com/containers (vs default runc)
  - Seems to better support new system calls

???
Fedora container unhappy on CentOS 7 kernel for example

### Future Plans

- Fully retire Puppet
  - Build missing Ansible roles
  - Move missing systems to Ansible
  - Decommission former Puppet masters
- Retire GlusterFS, only current volume is Puppet manifests/modules
- OS currency: retire RHEL 7, build RHEL 9 systems
- GitLab on OCP 4
- Databases on OCP 4 via existing Galera/PSQL operators
- Introduce Loki
- Deploy a Load Balancer in front of OCP 4 (any sponsor?)
- Move IPA to RHEL 9 and upgrade to latest IDM release
- Accounts / membership management self-service app

???
For accounts/membership management app, also mention password.gnome.org and
the idea of self-service being what we'd opt for to ease contributors accounts
and foundation membership management

### Tenant onboardings on OCP 4

- Are you interested in hosting an app on Openshift?
  - If yes, anyone with a GNOME Account has that capability
  - GNOME Project and eco-system related apps only
- Reach out to me directly after the talk if interested
